Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mom in the kitchen. One day, her mom asked her to go to the store to buy some salt. Lily was excited to help her mom, so she went to the store.
As she was walking to the store, she saw a beautiful butterfly. She wanted to catch it, but her mom said it was not safe. Lily was sad, but she remembered her mom's words and promised to be good.
At the store, Lily helped her mom pick out the salt. Her mom showed her a jar with a pretty butterfly inside. Lily was happy and felt successful in helping her mom. When they got back home, her mom gave her a small jar of salt to put in the jar. Lily felt proud and happy that she did a good job.achieved tok/s: 68.131050
